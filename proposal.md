# Advanced Mobile Applications - iOS

## Proposal

### Description

The proposal is for an iOS application which can be used to help owners of motorcycles and scooters 'crowdsource' the location of their vehicle in the event of a theft using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons.

### Context

Thefts of motorcycles and scooters are on the increase. It has been estimated [1] that 9,500 bikes are stolen each year in London alone. A GPS tracker may be fitted which can be used to report the vehicle's location to a central service (e.g. [2]) and therefore recover it if stolen, however prices for these devices start at Â£300 and usually also entail a monthly subscription charge, making them not economical for many riders.

### Target user group

The target market for this app are motorcycle and scooter owners living in densely populated urban areas with a known motorcycle crime problem such as central London. Users are expected to be running iOS 10 or later, covering 86% of the iOS device market [3].
